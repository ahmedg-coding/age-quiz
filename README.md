# Age Quiz

## Description
This Python program, prompts the user to input their age and then provides a humorous or informative message based on the input. The importance of this program lies in its introduction of fundamental programming concepts including user input, conditional statements (if-elif-else), and output, through a simple yet engaging interface that mimics real-world scenarios based on user input.

## Program Logic
- If the entered age is equal to or greater than 100, the program informs the user that they are deceased.
- If the age is 65 or greater, it encourages the user to enjoy their retirement.
- For ages between 40 and 64, it playfully suggests that the user is "over the hill."
- If the age is less than 13, it mentions eligibility for a kiddie discount.
- If the age is exactly 21, it congratulates the user on their 21st birthday.
- For all other ages, it simply states, "Age is but a number."


## Example
Enter your age: 18
Age is but a number.
